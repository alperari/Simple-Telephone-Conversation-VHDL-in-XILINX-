# Simple-Telephone-Conversation-VHDL-in-XILINX-
My verilog code for CS303 Term Project (Fall 2020)


A Simple Telephone Conversation You will design a sequential circuit for a simple two-sided telephone conversation and implement it using Verilog HDL. Then, you will simulate and show its functional correctness using Xilinx ISE tool. Basically, the caller will initiate a telephone conversation with the callee and the caller will send characters to the callee (and vice versa). Your circuit will calculate the cost of the call and send the cost value and the characters (sent from the caller to callee and vice versa) as outputs.
